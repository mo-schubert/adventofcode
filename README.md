#Training my devloper-brain

Due to some personal circumstances I'm currently not developing on a professional basis. Nevertheless, I want to keep my brain trained with solving some algorithmic problems. A friend told me about this nice challenge for software developers called "advent of code". In this repo I am publishing my implementation for these brain-twisters. I had fun while solving the challenges of the "advent for code". You may want to try them first, before looking at my implementation.

Currently I solved the folling days:
* Day 1
* Day 2
* Day 3
